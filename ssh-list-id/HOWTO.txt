  or
  $ wget http://vault.centos.org/8.1.1911/BaseOS/Source/SPackages/openssh-8.0p1-4.el8_1.src.rpm
  or ... etc.

2. download patches from github
  $ wget https://github.com/angel-p57/qiita-sample/blob/master/ssh-list-id/openssh-8.0p1-ssh-list-id.patch
  $ wget https://github.com/angel-p57/qiita-sample/blob/master/ssh-list-id/openssh.spec.8.0p1-4.el8_1.patch
  or
  $ git clone https://github.com/angel-p57/qiita-sample.git
    -> patches are in "ssh-list-id" subdirectory.

3. extrace source rpm
  $ rpm -ivh openssh-8.0p1-4.el8_1.src.rpm
    -> files are to extracted in ~/rpmbuild/{SOURCES,SPECS}

4. apply the patch files
  $ cp openssh-8.0p1-ssh-list-id.patch ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
  $ cp openssh.spec.8.0p1-4.el8_1.patch ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/
  $ cd ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
  $ patch < openssh.spec.8.0p1-4.el8_1.patch

5. rebuild openssh packages
  $ rpmbuild -bb openssh.spec
    -> new packages are saved in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/
